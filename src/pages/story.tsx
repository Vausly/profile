                    <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300">
                    I was previously using the name Lesunk Media because it was inspired by the Mobile Legends group I've created in early 2019. But in the middle of 2024 I rebranded from Lesunk Media to Vausly Media. I got the name Vausly from a combination of 2 things. The word "Vaus" in my brand name was inspirated from a
                    phishing virus ad website called Vaussneim.net which was active in late 2018 to 2019 which was owned by an ad shortlink site called AdFly which is now sold to Linkvertise. This is because that website was very annoying and hard to forget, especially when I was using a low device. Then -ly is a common
                    suffix added to adjectives in English language. But the suffix -ly itself is also used by IT startups such as <a href="https://bitly.com/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitly</a>, <a href="https://cutt.ly/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuttly</a>, <a href="https://adf.ly/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adfly (now Linkvertise)</a>, <a href="https://t.ly/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T.ly</a>, <a href="https://buff.ly/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buff.ly</a>, <a href="https://linkly.co/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkly</a>, <a href="https://rebrand.ly/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebrandly</a>, etc. Which makes it seem like the name is short and becomes easy to remember. And my own desire is to make my personal brand easy to remember.
                    And this proved because my channel grow faster than the previous 5 years. That's the short history of how I chose this name.

                    <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-purple-300">How it Started</h2>
                    <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300">
                    I was first introduced to the digital world in 2009, when I was introduced to a laptop. Furthermore, my journey in the internet world began in 2013, when an internet network was installed at home. However, at that time I only used it to play and have fun, such as playing games and watching YouTube.
                    In 2015 I was very happy with my hobby of writing, even though I was only limited to writing in books. At the end of 2015, I started to like writing stories on my cellphone in the Notebook app. This continued in 2016-2017 when I not only liked to write short stories, I liked to make my own stickman
                    comics which are now lost. I published some of my stories to my website which is now vausly.com with the title “Tim Kami” which I published in 2018. On the other side, I'm also interested in creativity-based games like Minecraft, where we can build anything you want.

                    <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-purple-300">What I have created</h2>
                    At that time in YouTube (in 2016), I also saw a creator who was very good at modding in the game Minecraft PE (now Minecraft Bedrock for Android) called Dennis Motta, also known as <a href="https://www.desno365.net/" className="text-purple-400 underline hover:text-purple-300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desno</a>. In 2017 I also shared my Minecraft creations such as Maps, Mods, and others that I made. Which at that time received a positive response from the UTK.io community. Until 
                    i leave completely on 2019 (this service closed on 01/01/2023). In 2017 i also create my first YouTube channel and getting my first subscriber on that channel (31 December 2017). This event makes me want to become a digital content creator. In the year after, I created a new channel, which is now my main
                    channel, and uploaded my first video on 31 December 2018. I faced many obstacles until I finally reached my first 1000 subscribers on 23 April 2023 and continued to grow again. I also post my videos on various platforms such as Instagram and TikTok.
